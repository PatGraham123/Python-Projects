#      The purpose of this program is to create a list of 20 real numbers then find the max, min, total, and average of these numbers.

numlist = []
index = 0
total = 0
average = 0
while index < 20:
  print("Please enter number",index+1,"of 20")
  number = float(input())
  total += number
  numlist.append(number)
  index += 1
average = total/len(numlist)
print(numlist)
print("The max is:",max(numlist))
print("The min is:",min(numlist))
print("The total is:","{:.2f}".format(total))
print("The average is:","{:.2f}".format(average))
